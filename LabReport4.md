# Lab Report 4
This Lab Report practices using shortcuts and commands to speed up the process that was done in the lab. This process includes logging into the remote server, cloning the repository, running the tests which should fail, fixing the error, run the tests which should pass, and then committing and pushing the changes. 

## Log Into ieng6
The image below shows me logging in to my ieng6 account. The only commands I used were `<up><enter>`. Since the last command I had done on my computer (not on the remote server) was to log into my ieng6 account, I simply had to press the up arrow key which filled in the last command I had used. Since this was the command I needed, I pressed enter to execute the command. And as shown in the image, the command worked.

## Cloning Fork of the Repository
The image below shows the command I used to clone the fork of the lab7 repository.

Instead of having to type out the entire command and URL, I used the command history to fill in the command for me. To do this, I used the sequence `<CTRL-R>git c<enter>`. `<CTRL-R>` opens the command history so I all I have to do is type the beginning of the command and it autocompletes the correlating command. However, I used multiple git commands so typing in only `git` produced `git add .` which is a command I use later. So once I typed out `git c` the only matching command was the git clone URL command as seen in the image below.
